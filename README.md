# Language Identification with Deep Learning

This project explores **automatic language identification** using deep learning techniques, developed as part of the *Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing* course at the University of Amsterdam (UvA).

The goal is to build a model that can correctly classify the language of a given text sample.
